# Iris-Flower-Classification-ML
Welcome to the Iris Flower Species Classification repository. In this project, we dive into the fascinating world of machine learning by working with the Iris flower dataset. This dataset comprises three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species are discernible based on specific measurements.
Imagine having a collection of Iris flower measurements, each categorized by its respective species. Our mission is clear: develop a robust machine learning model capable of learning from these measurements and accurately classifying Iris flowers into their correct species. This project showcases the power of supervised learning and classification in real-world applications.
